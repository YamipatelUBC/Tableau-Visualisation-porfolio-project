-- Query 1 in SQL (Big Querry)
Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
where continent is not null 
--Group By date
order by 1,2

-- Query 2 in SQL (Big Querry)

-- European Union is part of Europe

Select location, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From `practice-319122.coviddeaths.coviddeaths`
--Where location like '%states%'
Where continent is null 
and location not in ('World', 'European Union', 'International')
Group by location
order by TotalDeathCount desc

--Query 3 in SQL (Big Query)

Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From `practice-319122.coviddeaths.coviddeaths`
--Where location like '%states%'
Group by Location, Population
order by PercentPopulationInfected desc

--Query 4 in SQL (Big Query)

Select Location, Population,date, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From `practice-319122.coviddeaths.coviddeaths`
--Where location like '%states%'
Group by Location, Population, date
order by PercentPopulationInfected desc

-- Using all 4 queries we obtain 4 tables which will be used for Visualisation in Tableau.
